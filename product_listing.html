<p> Math can be difficult, but with Auxiliary, we make it easier. With curated study guides to better help learning
comphrehension, learning arithmitic operations has never been easier. We begin by sorting out these functions into its most basic form; adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Then we
incorporate study methods that aren't limited to just studying, but we apply these methods into real-world scenarios for them to experience the relevancy of these studies.
